BEAST MINERAL EXTRACTION

**Update 1/8/2023**
* Added recipes for more basic resources like wood, stone and bone to reduce the need to mine the environment impacting performance
* Added slow spoil rate and storage size for refrigerators

Updated Summary 1/8/20323:
Material Processor and the Mortar Pestel can process Trace Minerals dropped by haversting animal bones.  The Trace Minerals are more like a currency that you can process into just about any ore/resource you need.  The quantity and speed of this process means you don't have to mine for ores and most resource at all if you don't want to, instead progressing by hunting and haversting the trace minerals.


Old:


Late game to me has felt like a sim where I just run to 1 deep mining vein after another collecting resources.  Skipping the hunting part mostly and finding the animals to be annoying.  So on top of those trips, I wanted the kills to actually feel rewarding.  I also felt like the Material Processor is completely underrated for its name, so I wanted to make better use of it. This mod adds the following, including some QoL for excess Charcoal and the need for Oxite

* When destroying the animal bones from a killed creature, recieve "Trace Minerals" as a reward, scaled by bone harvesting
* From the Mortar and Pestel or Material Processor, convert the trace Minerals into raw ores (Faster and more efficient in the Material Processer)
* Convert charcoal into Coal Ore
* Extract oxite from fish (Material Processor Only)
* Create oxite from Fiber and Reed Flowers (Material Processor Only)


**Update 1/4/2023**
* Overhauled drop and conversion rates
* Should be possible to sustain ores from just killing animals now instead of mining






Thanks everyone on the Linkarus Discord for the details on how to do things like this and Jimk72 for the ModManager
