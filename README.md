**Thoughts behind this Mod**

Late game to me has felt like a sim where I just run to 1 deep mining vein after another collecting resources.  Skipping the hunting part that I enjoy so much in the early/mid game.  So on top of those trips, I wanted the kills to actually feel rewarding.  I also felt like the Material Processor is completely underrated for its name, so I wanted to make better use of it.  So I added the following recipes:

* Extract the minerals within creatures' bones to ore's
* Convert charcoal into Coal Ore
* Extract oxite from fish
* Extract the left over bones from Raw meat

Added
* Convert Bones to precious Ore's
* Convery Fish to oxite
* Convert Charcoal to Coal Ore
* Convery Raw Meat to bones


Thanks everyone on the Linkarus Discord for the details on how to do things like this and Jimk72 for the ModManager
